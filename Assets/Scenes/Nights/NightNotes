Night 1/ Daytime:

Will be bright/dark and just be the player playing tetris no monster and no threat. If the player loses they aren't jumpscared but they have to restart the night

Night 2:

The introduction of the flashlight is added and the monster is also introduced. This will be the first time the player will have a threat and need to multi task.

Night 3:

Tetris becomes harder, the demon will have potentially more angles of attack. For example he could spawn on the side of the bed and you need to shine the flashlight at him before time runs out. 

Night 4: 

Flashlight dies easier, potentially more demons?? Higher tetris scores will need to be met. Potentially more places to attack from.

Night 5:

Tetris goes even faster. Demons attack faster and more often. Higher tetris score.
