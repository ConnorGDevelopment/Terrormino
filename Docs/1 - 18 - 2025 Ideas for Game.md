# 1 - 18 - 2025 - Ideas we came up with for the game!

## Tetris gameplay ideas 
Tetris game will not necessarily ramp up in speed as the game goes on, but special blocks or other sorts of events would happen on the console to add originality and to add difficulty as time goes on. Shapes of the blocks might be different.

## Flashlight ideas: 
When you pick up the flashlight, you must click a button (ZR or shaking the object for example) to turn it on to add that little bit of extra interaction to catch a player off guard if they don’t remember. A potential idea is that when you try and turn on the flashlight it has a slight chance to not turn on or flicker, forcing the player to try and turn it on again until it works.

## Room Design ideas: 
To reflect the “Frankenstein/connected pieces that don’t fit” vibe, design the room to be a jarring mix of antique and children’s things. Since the player character is a child, and lives with his abusive parents, his parents don’t care for his room to look how he wants. Because of this, he must put his childlike things on antique/more adultism looking things because his room is not designed to be “his room” but rather a room he is told to live in. Think of it like an antique table with action figures on it for example. These things should potentially appear scary or uncanny to scare the player and make them uncomfortable. Stuff from his parents is placed in his room, such as a painting that his parents own that looks scary to the kid, or maybe his dad’s boot by the hallway door. Major influence of “mix mash of stages of life”
